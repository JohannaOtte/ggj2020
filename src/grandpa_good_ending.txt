Sammy: “You have always been this way. Even Dad wondered till the end if you love him, even just a little bit.” 

CHAR: Grandpa_01
Grandpa:”Of course i loved him. He was so very precious to me. You have no Idea what you´re talking about!”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “And how come you never showed him?”

CHAR: Grandpa_01
Grandpa: “I tried to. But after the war I trapped all the hurt inside. I tried not to get attached to someone again so I don't have to feel this pain of losing someone close to me. But now that your dad is gone, it hurts so much. I will never see my boy again. And I can't make up for all the times I missed to tell him, how much I loved him. This robot heart is the only thing I have. So I can't give it to you. I am sorry.” 

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “But… it isn't the only thing. You still have me. I can tell you all the stories he told me about you. Tell you, how much he loved you. You don't have to be afraid to show others, how you feel.”

CHAR: Grandpa_01
Grandpa: “Maybe you´re right. Maybe you are my last chance to make things right.”
