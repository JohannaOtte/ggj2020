Mom: “So what were you just saying?”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “Ahh, it's not really that important. How have you been the last couple of years?”

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “Well, after you and your father left, I started working again. But because I´ve been a housewife for so long, it's hard to find decent work. So I'm working as a maid, cleaning other peoples homes. Isn't that funny?!”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “I just hope you don't have to take care of their kids as well…”

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “What is that supposed to mean?”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “It's just… well you never really were the thoughtful type.”

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “What?! Haven't I always given my best to make all of your favorite meals? How can you say, I'm not thoughtful?”
