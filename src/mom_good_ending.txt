Sammy: “You never really listened to me when I was little. Remember when I told you how miserable and lonely I was! No, of course you don't! Have you ever cared about me?“ 

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “I… I did! But I don't know how to be a good mother. I did, what I could. I prepared the meals and did the dishes, laundry and all that. And your dad was always working. I wanted to do so much and never could, because I was expected to center my life around you. In the end that's just not who I am. I am sorry I wasn't able to be the person you needed me to be.”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “But I never needed a perfect mother. All I wanted was for you to tell me your dreams and listen to mine. Maybe we could have build a world of our own. Maybe we could have done all the things you wanted to do together.“

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “Do you think we could start over?”

CHAR: Sammy_01
Sammy: “Maybe… If you really want to, we could start with DOT. It's my dream to finish the robot dad build. Will you help me?”

CHAR: Mom_02
Mom: “If it helps making things between us better, I will.”
